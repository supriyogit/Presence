#Goal: 
1. Whether a person is Indoor/Outdoor
2. What is the actual place (home/office/restaurant) the person is in.

Possible Sensors
1. GPS
2. Wi-Fi 
3. Accelerometer

Possible Signals
1. GPS fix
2. Indoor GPS fix will take a longer time
3. Indoor Wi-Fi will be visible
4. Signal strength/ number of satellites used for the fix
5. Accelerometers

Algorithm: Will try to make use of a combination of these sensors to figure out if the person is indoor/outdoor


PseudoCode:
prevTime = 0;
currLoc = '';
currAct = '';

if( currTime - prevTime > 3000 )
{
	a. If we did not get a GPS fix, likely indoors.
	b. Check accelerometer data
		if (var(acceleration) < threshold) 
			currAct = still;
		else
			currAct = moving;
		end
		
        c.
